##Time and The Internet - Express version

This is a trial made to see if the program for the performance of Time and the Internet could be accompanied with an app using the express and the express generator structure.

The program should:
- generate a new title (in a set order) when clicked
- generate a new piece of music (from a playlist, in order), when clicked
- time from the moment of the first click (currently 55 minutes) to generate the final title and song regardless of whether it is clicked at that time
